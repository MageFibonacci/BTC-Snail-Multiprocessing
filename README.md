# BTC-Snail-Multiprocessing
This is a **modified version** of the [Snail](https://github.com/iceland2k14/snail) tool originally created by **iceland2k14**. The modifications add support for **KeyRange search**, **multiprocessing**, a **queue manager**, and **precalculation of sequential increments** along with their `h160` values.
